* Supervised learning

  * input = (data, correct output)
  * Labeled data and classification problems
  * Generalize. Predicting known labels
  
  * Create a predictive mode from the "generalization"
  * Use the predictive model to label unseen data.

  * A vending machine that identifies the value of a coin by looking at its mass and size in supervised learning a 2D plot and a set of labeled data for each coin value in unsupervised learning a set of data without labeling as it can be seen from the 2D mass/size plot will show clusters that are not yet labeld but can be separated

* Unsupervised learning

  * Input = (data, )	
  * "Not right answer". Just receive the input. A higher level representation
  * The example: Learning portugueese just by listening to the radio "you get a model of the language" and it will be easier for you to learm even if you don't have "the labels".

* Reinforcement learning

  * Input =  (data, "some" output, grade for output)
  * Playing games being one of the most important applications
  * It needs to have grades for output == needs "someone" to teach
